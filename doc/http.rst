Http Module
=========================

This is something I want to say that is not in the docstring.

.. autoclass:: dragline.http.Request
   :members: __init__, send


.. class:: Response

    .. attribute:: url (str)
    
        url from where html content is fetched
    
    .. attribute:: body (str)
    
        html content of response
    
    .. attribute:: headers (dict)
